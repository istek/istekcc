My son,

The day you were borned,

The very forest of Lorderan whellispered the name:

Arthas.

My child,

I watch u with pride, as you grow into a weapon of righteousness.

Remember, Our land has always ruled with wisdom and strength.

And i know,

You would show restraint, when you exercising your great power.

But the truest victory my son,

Is stiring hearts of your people.

I tell you this

For when my days have come to an end,

You, Shall be king.

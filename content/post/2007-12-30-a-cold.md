终于，自己还是感冒了，大前天天气特别冷啊，尤其是下午刮了土，当天我还骑车，晚上加班，回家的时候都11点多了，骑车的感觉，那叫一个冷啊，没有想到，自己的身体竟然一点都不争气，竟然感冒了。

两天了，尤其是今天难受的要死。今天是放假的前一天，还好没有很多事情，今天就是去定西一趟，给一个客户更换部件。不过回到兰州已经晚上8点多了，回家的路上Oliver给我打电话，想约我出去坐坐。我心想回家也没有什么事情可做，于是饭也没吃，匆匆回单位拿了书包就直奔约定地点了。

注定是看书啊，因为每次oliver都不说话，在那死是个抽烟。而我呢，又无所事可做，于是乎，拿出手机，看《诛仙》吧，就这样，一个晚上就这样不知不觉间度过了。

外面冷的出奇，眼里是张小凡的坎坷人生，可自己的心里却无法平静。不知道为什么，人在生病的时候，尤其会觉得孤独特别的可怕，也许我像其他人一样吧，需要被关怀，被呵护。“羡慕”现在对我来说，似乎是一种“奢望”了吧。

还有两天，2007年将会成为历史，这一年中的每一天将会成为我的一部分记忆。即将跨入人生的第二十八个年头了，心里着实不是滋味。三分之一的人生悄悄的走了，将会剩下什么？

What a bad luck! I finally cought a cold! It&#8217;s very cold three days ago, especially that day was raising a dust, I don&#8217;t know why I rode my motor. I have been back home at 23 for working overtime. I felt deeply for the feeling of ride! Of course, base on my physical strength, I centainly cought a cold.

I feel worse today. It&#8217;s very lucky that few something to do at the day before holiday. Today I was going to Dingxi for a case, which is replaced a custom&#8217;s part.I have been lanzhou at 8. Oliver called me on my way home, he wanna make a date with me, yeah, our similar nest,which is before time. Although I didn&#8217;t have dinner yet, I got nothing to do at home, perhaps it&#8217;s a good idea.Finally, I took my bag to the place we dated in a hurry.

Well, because oliver doesn&#8217;t chat with me actively, the only thing i can do is reading every time. Whatever it is, Let it be. Soon it&#8217;s time to go home.

It&#8217;s very cold outside. I never feel peaceful, but a rough life of Zhang Xiaofan,who is a character in a novel. I wonder that the lonely feeling is so strong, maybe I need to be cared as I&#8217;m sicking. the mood is rather than waitting for.

Two days, everything happened on this year will be history, it destines to become a part of mine. I will be the age of 28, a third life is passed by, what else is left? That&#8217;s the only question I need think about.

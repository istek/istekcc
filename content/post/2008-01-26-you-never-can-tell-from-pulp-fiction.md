The movie Pulp Fiction is a wonderful movie I’ve never seen.This movie clip is found at someone’s blog.

Swing is so hot and bewitched. John is not a movie star but a swing dancer, before he is known by people. And the movie is the most recommandation for violence.

The other point is it exactly describ the culture in the 70’s. I wish you guys to watch and enjoy it. Please remeber “Violence is a cycle, and continuous”.

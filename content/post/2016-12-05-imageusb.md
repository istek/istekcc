ImageUSB是一款允许同时将镜像写入多个USB设备的免费工具。

其官方介绍如下：

> **ImageUSB is a free utility which lets you write an image concurrently to multiple USB Flash Drives.** Capable of creating exact bit-level copies of USB Flash Drive (UFDs), ImageUSB is an extremely effective tool for the mass duplication of UFDs. ImageUSB also supports writing of an ISO file byte by byte directly to an USB drive (*). ImageUSB can also be used to install OSFClone to a USB Drive for use with PassMark OSForensics&#x2122;.
>
>
> Unlike other USB duplication tools, **ImageUSB can preserve all unused and slack space during the cloning process**, including the Master Boot Record (MBR). ImageUSB can perform flawless mass duplications of all UFD images, including bootable UFDs.
>
>
> imageUSB includes functionality to Zero a USB Flash Drive. This will replace the contents of the entire drive with 0s. Or alternatively to just Zero the MBR and/or GPT entries that exists on the drive. In addition, imageUSB has the ability to reformat even hard to format drives and reclaim any disk space that may be lost previously.

前两天装manjaro的时候，用win32 diskimage 效果不行啊，后发现这个工具，效果不错，故推荐给各位。

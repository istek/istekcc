daniel powter 就是在十九届金曲奖上弹着钢琴歌唱的人!

加拿大人的Daniel Powter，是外表与内在兼备的全能歌手。钢琴的功力非常深厚,唱腔也有点英伦的感觉!新专辑内的十首心情小品，均是他一手创作的。整张专辑呈现了多元 化的风貌，除了Bad Day曲风较具POP气味以外，其他的歌某种程度上和Remy Shand有些神似，除了稍带灵魂乐风之外，又适当加入了放克等音乐元素，使每首歌都呈现出了极其个性化的“inner ego”。值得一提的是，Daniel Powter驾驭自如的真假音切换，使每首歌曲跌宕起伏而不沦于单调，尤其是在描述谎言爱情的Lie To Me中，更是得以淋漓尽致的发挥。首支主打Bad Day的MV描述的是一对相隔咫尺、却一直素不相识的男女，在各自生活里或喜或悲，并最终因为个性深处的契合而走近彼此的故事。而它又不仅仅是一出“向左 走，向右走”的爱情小品，歌曲背地里折射出来的现代人的生活观，则是可以使之意味悠长的原因所在。Daniel Powter就是这样，你会觉得他像一位长久“在路上”的诗人，或者是与你在地铁站内擦肩而过的行者，你大可不必怜惜他在因何而忧伤不定，他是快乐的，并 在怀着一种坚定而感恩的心，活着。本张2005年的全新专辑，其中单曲Bad Day连续十周占据瑞士单曲榜冠军。

I am writing this article, as an _How to_ for installing the Flat Theme, called Flatabulous for Ubuntu. This might work for other desktop environments, but I have only thoroughly tested it on Ubuntu Unity desktop.

_The terminal_

To install the theme, you must first install the [**Ubuntu tweak tool**](http://ubuntu-tweak.com/). It can be installed by simply running the command :
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak
```

or heading over to their website, downloading the .deb file (recommended).

Then, you can download the source to the theme [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/archive/master.zip). If you are a developer or a designer, I also encourage you to contribute to it. Create a folder, called .theme in your home directory. This can be simply created by firing up your terminal, and then running
```
mkdir .themes
```

Now this is a hidden directory, to view this in Nautilus, you can press `Ctrl/⌘ + H`. Alternatively, youc an also place the extracted files in your `/usr/share/themes/`folder.

### Flat Icons

_Dashboard_

For Icons, I use the ultra-flat-icons theme. It is available in blue (recommended), orange and mint green colors. To install this, you can run the following commands
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/icons
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons
```

Alternatively, you could also run`sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-orange`或者`sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-green.`

based on you color preference. I recommend these flat icons, but you can also look at **Numix** and **Flattr**.

Now press your super key, search for **Ubuntu Tweak** and fire it. Under the tweaks tab, there is an option for theme. Under that select the **Flatabulous**theme. Under the icon settings, select **ultra-flat-icons**. Restart your computer, and you should be good to go! You computer will look something like this after you _restart_.

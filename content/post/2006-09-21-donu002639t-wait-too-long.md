这是一首Jazz风格的歌曲，是Madeleine Peyroux演绎得，歌曲风格比较慵懒，很舒服的感觉。试听可到侧边栏MUSIC里面收听。以后每次我换页面歌曲之后，都会将歌曲的下载地址贴出来的。

Don’t Wait Too Long

You can cry a million tears

You can wait a million years

If you think that time will change your ways

Donґt wait too long

When your morning turns to night

Who’ll be loving you by candlelight

If you think that time will change your ways

Don’t wait too long

Maybe I got a lot to learn

Time can slip away

Sometimes you got to lose it all

Before you find your way

Take a chance, play your part

Make romance, it might break your heart

But if you think that time will change your ways

Don’t wait too long

It may rain, it may shine

Love will age like fine red wine

But if you think that time will change your ways

Don’t wait too long

Maybe you and I got a lot to learn

Don’t waste another day

Maybe you got to lose it all

Before you find your way

Take a chance, play your part

Make romance, it might break your heart

But if you think that time will change your ways

Don’t wait too long

Don’t wait

Hmm… Don’t wait

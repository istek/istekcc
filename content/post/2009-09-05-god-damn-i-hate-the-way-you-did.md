As we know, several days ago China goverment has blocked .co.cc domain, right now i just wanna show you how i m angry!

At first, i thought maybe my website was something wrong with it. And i contact with hosting administrator, he suggested me to use normal domain like xxxx.2kmegs.com to try again. You know what happened? it works well! and then i doubt our gfw has block it. After that, i confirmed it at some chinese free forums.

God damn! What a fucking country we live! no freedom! Everything you do is under someone’s controll. Well, what can i say?  if i were doing, maybe some guys put me in jail!

At present, I have transfered my domain to other place. and from now on, my domain name is stanleyzhou.org.ru. i wish no more block, no more gfw!!!

在有些办公场景中，我们需要有一根VPN连接到办公室的网络上，这样便于操作办公室的电脑。经过测试了两款VPN软件后，还是选择了openvpn，但是frp+openvpn有一个特殊要求，即公网的服务器带宽越大越好，1M的VPS实在是太痛苦了，不过聊胜于无啊。

下面就是配置过程，请看。

## 生成证书

三种证书，服务器证书，客户端证书，openvpn密钥

```
init-config.bat     # init-config 会把 vars.bat.sample 复制为 var.bat
vars.bat            # vars.bat 用来设置一些变量，主要就是配置文件中修改的那部分
clean-all.bat       # 会清掉 C: \Program File\OpenVPN\easy-rsa\keys 目录，再把 index.txt 和 serial 文件放进来。
build-ca.bat        # 生成根证书
build-dh.bat        # 生成 dh1024.pem 文件，Server 使用 TLS(OpenSSL) 必须要有的文件
build-key-server.bat server01 # 生成服务端密钥和证书

# server01 是自己定义的参数名，与上相应的就会生成 server01.key、server01.csr 和 server01.crt，也都是在 keys 目录里。

# 这一步像 build-dh.bat 一样有些东西要填写，之后就是该回答 y 的 y 一下，关键就一个：
# Common Name 必须填，且不能与执行 build-dh 时相同，否则会报：
# failed to update database
# TXT_DB error number 2
# 找不到 C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa\keys\*.old

# 三个文件 server01.key、server01.csr 和 server01.crt 也会生成，但文件 server01.crt 的大小是 0 字节无效的，就要重新再来，看到 Data Base Updated 才行。

# 要生成多个服务端的密钥和证书则继续 build-key-server server02 ......

build-key.bat client   #客户端生成密钥和证书

# 与build-ca和build-key-server一样要输入一堆东西，这里注意的是 Common Name 不能与执行 build-key-server 时输入的一样，否则也是报：

# failed to update database
# TXT_DB error number 2
# 找不到 C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa\keys\*.old

# 要生成其他的客户端密钥和证书，可以继续 build-key.bat client02 ......

# 生成 ta.key 文件
..\bin\openvpn --genkey --secret keys\ta.key
```

## 服务端配置
将`ca.crt`、`ca.key`、`server01.crt`、`server01.csr`、`server01.key`、`dh2048.pem`、`ta.key`复制到`$OPENVPN/config`目录中，配置server.opvn。

# Use "dev tap0" if you are ethernet bridging
# and have precreated a tap0 virtual interface
# and bridged it with your ethernet interface.
# If you want to control access policies
# over the VPN, you must create firewall
# rules for the the TUN/TAP interface.
# On non-Windows systems, you can give
# an explicit unit number, such as tun0.
# On Windows, use "dev-node" for this.
# On most systems, the VPN will not function

# SSL/TLS root certificate (ca), certificate
# (cert), and private key (key).  Each client

# use the same ca file.
#
# See the "easy-rsa" directory for a series
# of scripts for generating RSA certificates
# and private keys.  Remember to use
# a unique Common Name for the server
# and each of the client certificates.

# Configure server mode and supply a VPN subnet
# for OpenVPN to draw client addresses from.
# The server will take 10.8.0.1 for itself,
# the rest will be made available to clients.
# Each client will be able to reach the server
# on 10.8.0.1. Comment this line out if you are
# ethernet bridging. See the man page for more info.

# Maintain a record of client <-> virtual IP address
# associations in this file.  If OpenVPN goes down or
# is restarted, reconnecting clients can be assigned
# the same virtual IP address from the pool that was
# previously assigned.
ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging.
# You must first use your OS's bridging capability
# to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet
# NIC interface.  Then you must manually set the
# IP/netmask on the bridge interface, here we
# assume 10.8.0.4/255.255.255.0.  Finally we
# must set aside an IP range in this subnet
# (start=10.8.0.50 end=10.8.0.100) to allocate
# to connecting clients.  Leave this line commented
# out unless you are ethernet bridging.
;server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.50 10.8.0.100

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging
# using a DHCP-proxy, where clients talk
# to the OpenVPN server-side DHCP server
# to receive their IP address allocation
# and DNS server addresses.  You must first use
# your OS's bridging capability to bridge the TAP
# interface with the ethernet NIC interface.
# Note: this mode only works on clients (such as
# Windows), where the client-side TAP adapter is
# bound to a DHCP client.
;server-bridge

# Push routes to the client to allow it
# to reach other private subnets behind
# the server.  Remember that these
# private subnets will also need
# to know to route the OpenVPN client
# address pool (10.8.0.0/255.255.255.0)
# back to the OpenVPN server.
;push "route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0"
;push "route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0"

# To assign specific IP addresses to specific
# clients or if a connecting client has a private
# subnet behind it that should also have VPN access,
# use the subdirectory "ccd" for client-specific
# configuration files (see man page for more info).

# EXAMPLE: Suppose the client
# having the certificate common name "Thelonious"
# also has a small subnet behind his connecting
# machine, such as 192.168.40.128/255.255.255.248.
# First, uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# Then create a file ccd/Thelonious with this line:
#   iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# This will allow Thelonious' private subnet to
# access the VPN.  This example will only work
# if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are
# using "dev tun" and "server" directives.

# EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to give
# Thelonious a fixed VPN IP address of 10.9.0.1.
# First uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.252
# Then add this line to ccd/Thelonious:
#   ifconfig-push 10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2

# Suppose that you want to enable different
# firewall access policies for different groups
# of clients.  There are two methods:
# (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each
#     group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface
#     for each group/daemon appropriately.
# (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically
#     modify the firewall in response to access
#     from different clients.  See man
#     page for more info on learn-address script.
;learn-address ./script

# If enabled, this directive will configure
# all clients to redirect their default
# network gateway through the VPN, causing
# all IP traffic such as web browsing and
# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN
# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT
# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet
# in order for this to work properly).
;push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

# Certain Windows-specific network settings
# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS
# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:
# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats
# The addresses below refer to the public
# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"

# Uncomment this directive to allow different
# clients to be able to "see" each other.
# By default, clients will only see the server.
# To force clients to only see the server, you
# will also need to appropriately firewall the
# server's TUN/TAP interface.
;client-to-client

# Uncomment this directive if multiple clients
# might connect with the same certificate/key
# files or common names.  This is recommended
# only for testing purposes.  For production use,
# each client should have its own certificate/key
# pair.
#
# IF YOU HAVE NOT GENERATED INDIVIDUAL
# CERTIFICATE/KEY PAIRS FOR EACH CLIENT,
# EACH HAVING ITS OWN UNIQUE "COMMON NAME",
# UNCOMMENT THIS LINE OUT.
;duplicate-cn

# The keepalive directive causes ping-like
# messages to be sent back and forth over
# the link so that each side knows when
# the other side has gone down.
# Ping every 10 seconds, assume that remote
# peer is down if no ping received during
# a 120 second time period.
keepalive 10 120

# For extra security beyond that provided
# by SSL/TLS, create an "HMAC firewall"
# to help block DoS attacks and UDP port flooding.
#
# Generate with:
#   openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
#
# The server and each client must have
# a copy of this key.
# The second parameter should be '0'
# on the server and '1' on the clients.
tls-auth ta.key 0 # This file is secret

# Select a cryptographic cipher.
# This config item must be copied to
# the client config file as well.
# Note that v2.4 client/server will automatically
# negotiate AES-256-GCM in TLS mode.
# See also the ncp-cipher option in the manpage
cipher AES-256-CBC

# Enable compression on the VPN link and push the
# option to the client (v2.4+ only, for earlier
# versions see below)
;compress lz4-v2
;push "compress lz4-v2"

# For compression compatible with older clients use comp-lzo
# If you enable it here, you must also
# enable it in the client config file.

# It's a good idea to reduce the OpenVPN

# By default, log messages will go to the syslog (or
# on Windows, if running as a service, they will go to
# the "\Program Files\OpenVPN\log" directory).
# Use log or log-append to override this default.
# "log" will truncate the log file on OpenVPN startup,
# while "log-append" will append to it.  Use one
# or the other (but not both).

# sequential messages of the same message
# category will be output to the log.

## 客户端配置
将`client01.crt`、`client01.csr`、`client01.key`、`ca.key`、`ca.crt`、`ta.key`文件复制到客户端的`$OPENVPN/config`目录中，配置client.ovpn文件。

## 路由转发

### windows
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
将IPEnableRouter改为1
```
关闭防火墙或将服务端口加入到防火墙允许通过的端口中。
### Linux
```
/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf
增加
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
## 其他事项

在windows下，我发现在生成证书的时候，会报如下的错误：
```
TLS: Initial packet from [AF_INET]xxx:52354, sid=1ca6d405 99996881
VERIFY ERROR: depth=0, error=CRL signature failure: C=CN, ST=BJ, L=Beijin ….
OpenSSL: error:140890B2:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE:no certificate returned
```

原因: openssl 或者 openvpn 不支持md5，需要换成sha1或者sha256。
解决办法：
### 方法一：
修改openssl-1.0.0.cnf，并重新生成crl证书。
```
default_md = md5
```
改成
```
default_md = sha256
```
生成crl的命令：
```
openssl ca -gencrl -out keys/crl.pem -config openssl-1.0.0.cnf
//revoke-full 脚本是调用的上面的命令
```
查看crl的命令：
```
openssl crl -text -in keys/crl.pem
```

### 方法二：
添加环境变量，允许MD5算法，然后重启openvpn
```
NSS_HASH_ALG_SUPPORT=+MD5
OPENSSL_ENABLE_MD5_VERIFY=1
```

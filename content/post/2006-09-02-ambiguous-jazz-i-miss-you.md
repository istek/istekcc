2001年，爵士名厂Verve签下这位日本第一的优质女声，开启她自此光芒四射的魅力人生。4张专辑堆砌出如潮好评的佳绩，连续享得SwingJournal Jazz、New Star Award等重量级奖项肯定，销售与排行如日中天，而知名化妆品牌雅诗兰黛的「Defining Beauty Award」，为她戴上了完美女伶的后冠。

2004最新专辑「芳心之歌Mood Indigo」以艾灵顿公爵的经典同名单曲为标题作品，填词重唱Straight No Chaser、SoTired等爵士名曲，辅以其日臻至境的自创曲I Miss You、In the Afternoon等动人佳作，又是一幅染尽爵士、R&B、Funk、Lounge等无设限音乐元素的绝妙画布，在沉静与跃动的交迭中，唱出最淋漓尽致的自由… i miss you

akiko-i miss you

A couple seasons
just passed me by
since you made me feel so real
That feeling I remember,
it was as good as it can be.
I haven’t seen you for a while,
I wonder if you are well.
What’s going on in your mind,
I really would like to see.
I try to see but it won’t do,
it’s taking time to get near.
Something is hart to explain
I wonder can I tell you.
We haven’t been talking much
it doesn’t mean I don’t care
Should I just call you to say
I’m falling and I miss you.
oooh hoo
Wish I was with you in my dreams
and I’m praying to be by your side
and suddenly you’ll slip away
oooh hoo
Easy as flowing down the stream
Do you know that
Will you understand me
Why is it you make me wait so long
Sometimes do you think of me
as much as I think of you
I’d like to know when you dream
Am I there
Do you miss me
I know you can’t share life with me
and I don’t know what to do
but if you walk right thru my door,
you will see that I miss you
In my heart
I want you
to know that
I miss you
